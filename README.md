### How to build

With `pnpm`, you can build by running `pnpm build && pnpm bundle`.

The output will be in the directory `/bundle/index.js`.



### How to use in browsers

Put the bundled file `index.js` (see above) in your directory, and load the file in HTML as following:

```HTML
<script src="/your-directory/index.js"></script>
```

After that, you can execute KAL code with `window.kal.execute(code-to-execute)` as follows:

```HTML
<script>
    window.kal.execute("5+5"); // === 10
</script>
```
